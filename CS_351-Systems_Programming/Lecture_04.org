* I/O Devices

* Storage Devices

* Processor (CPU)
Basic function is to execute instructions.

** ALU
These instructions include:
   * arithmetic
   * boolean
   * memory fetching
   * Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data

** Control Unit
   * Controls processing of instructions
   * Controls movement of data within the CPU

** Interface Unit
   * Move instructions and data between CPU and other hardware components
   * /Bus/- Bundle of wires for power and data

** Multicore Processors
   * Each core has an independent execution pipeline
   * Each core may be doing something different
   * Crossing between dies on the same CPU is costly
   * Crossing CPUs is even more costly
   * Multidie CPUs are becoming quite a bit more prevalent.

* Graphics (GPU)
  * Symmetric Multiprocessors
  * Highly parallelized tasks
  * GPU is like a CPU, in terms of the very basic architecture
  * Optimized to render graphics
  * Run at lower frequencies
  * Lose ability to execute different instructions on different cores
    - Single Instruction, Multiple Data

* Memory Hierarchy
** Processor Registers
** Processor Cache
** Random Access Memory
** Flash Memory
   * SATA/SAS
   * NVMe
   * DDR
** Hard Drives
   * Mechanical
   * Slowest
   * Highest Capacity
   * Highest Latency
   * Consume a lot of power, compared to SSDs
** Tape Drives

* Network
  * Need a comunication channel
  * Switches needed to interconnect computers
  * Routers need for routing packets

** Network Interface Cards (NIC)
   * Physical connections
