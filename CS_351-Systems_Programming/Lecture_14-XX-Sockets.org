* Communication Protocols
  * Protocols are agreement and rules on communication
  * These can be connection-oriented or connectionless
  * These protocols are typically built with a layered architecture-
    1. Physical
    2. Data Link
    3. Netowrk
    4. Transport
    5. Session
    6. Presentation
    7. Application
  * These messages build off each other by wrapping the higher-level protocol in a lower one.

** Physical
   * How to encode 0s and 1s
   * What voltages are used
   * How long does a bit need to be signaled
   * What doe sthe cable, plug, antenna look like?

** Data Link
   * How big is a frame
   * Can I detect an error
   * What marks an end of a frame
   * How do I control access to a shared channel (Flow Control)

** Network
   * How to route packets
   * Congestion control algorithm
     - Traffic Shaping
     - Flow Specifications
     - Bandwidth reservation
   * Accounting
   * Fragment or combine packets

** Transport Layer
   * How to order messages and detect duplicates
   * Error detection
   * Retransmission
   * Connection-oriented vs. Connectionless

** Session and Presentation
   *

** Application
   * What marks the subject field
   * How to represent cursor movements
   * Services
     - SMTP
     - FTP
     - HTTP
     - SNMP
     - NFS
     - NTP
     - NNTP

* Middleware Protocols
