* Recall
  * Von Neumann Architecture
  * Stored program computer with programs and data stored /in the same memory/.
  * We /idealize/ memory as a storage device
    - Holds programs (Instructions)
    - Holds data (Operands)
  * Memory is byte-addressible array of bytes
  * Code & data reside on the hard drive
    - ~execlp("/bin/echo", "/bin/echo", "hello", NULL)~
  * In reality, memory is a combination fo storage systems with very different characteristics
    - Registers
    - Caches
      + L1
      + L2
      + L3
    - Memory
    - Disk

* Types of Memory
** SRAM
   * Static Random Access Memory
   * Data is stable as long as power is applied
   * 6+ transistors per bit
     - D-flip-flop
     - This is complex and expensive, but very fast
   * Used for processor caches

** DRAM
   * Dynamic Random Access Memory
   * 1 Capacitor + 1 Transistor for each bit
     - Requires a periodic refresh of the bit in memory
     - *MUCH* denser and cheaper than [[*SRAM][SRAM]]
   * Main memory

** NVRAM
   * Non-Volatile Random Access Memory
   * Data persists without power
   * 1+ bits/transistor (Low read/write granularity)
   * Updates may require block erasure
   * Limited number of writes per block (100K+)
     - These disks also have wear-leveling to prevent this on a hardware level
     - Modern operating systems are aware of this fact and handle it
   * Flash disks
   * Interfaces
     - SATA
     - SCSI
     - eSATA
     - nVME (Attached to PCIe bus)

** HDD
   * Hard Disk Drive
   * Spinning magnetic platters with multiple read/write heads
     - Data access requires /mechanical seek/
     - The platters must spin to find the data.
   * Spin speeds
     - 5400 RPM
     - 7200 RPM
     - 15000 RPM
   * Random access is *very* slow
   * Sequential access is much faster, because we don't need to spin the disk to find anything
   * Price per gigabyte is *MUCH* lower
   * Much greater capacities
     - Several terabytes in a single disk.

** Distance and Speed
   * The speed of light is roughly 1 ft/ns
   * In a 3GHz CPU, we can travel 4 in/cycle
   * Thus, the maximum access distance (round trip) for access in a single cycle is 2 in.
     - Anything further will require multiple cycles to access
   * Thus, it is best to keep things as close as possible to the CPU.

** Relative Speeds
| Type                         | Size         | Access Latency     | Unit     |
|------------------------------+--------------+--------------------+----------|
| Registers                    | 8-32 words   | 0-1 cycles         | ns       |
| On-board SRAM (L1/L2 Cache)  | 32-256 KiB   | 1-3 cycles         | ns       |
| Off-board SRAN (L2/L3 Cache) | 256KiB-16MiB | ~10 cycles         | ns       |
| DRAM                         | 128MiB-64GiB | ~100 cycles        | ns       |
| SSD                          | \leq 1TiB    | ~10,000 cycles     | \micro s |
| HDD                          | \leq 4TiB    | ~10,000,000 cycles | ms       |
