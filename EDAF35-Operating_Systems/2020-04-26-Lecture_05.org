* Questions
  * Really need to register for a lab section, since all remote?
    - Not really needed.
    - They will handle it.
  * Difference between Logical and Virtual Memory?
    - Logical is a bit more general
    - Don't need virtual memory to talk about logical
    - Logical is what CPU gives to MMU
    - Physical is what MMU gives to memory
    - Virtual is what the Process sees within itself
  * How does ~vfork()~ allow for an immediate ~exec()~ in the child without the parent changing?
    - ~vfork()~ does not use copy-on-write
    - If child process changes any pages of the parentâ€™s address space, altered pages visible to the parent once it resumes.
    - Child is its own process too, so the parent is not replaced
    - ~exec()~ creates a new address space for the child, so the parent is unaffected
  * Modify Bit on page or frame
    - Page = Virtual/Logical Memory
    - Frame = Physical Memory
    - On Frame, but it tells whether the page that the frame is hosting has been modified.
